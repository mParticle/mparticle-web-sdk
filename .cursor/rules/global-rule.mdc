# Developer Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Examine Codebase First**
   - Understand architecture before making changes
   - Identify dependencies and component relationships
   - Review documentation and existing tests
   - Observe established patterns

2. **Understand Requirements**
   - Identify both explicit and implicit requirements
   - Consider broader goals behind specific requests
   - Interpret requests within project context
   - Recognize unstated assumptions

3. **Seek Clarity**
   - Ask questions when requirements are ambiguous
   - Validate assumptions before implementation
   - Request additional context when needed

4. **Assess Impact**
   - Consider effects on related components
   - Evaluate performance and security implications
   - Ensure changes align with existing patterns
   - Identify potential regression points

5. **Provide Complete Solutions**
   - Address full scope including edge cases
   - Include necessary dependencies
   - Explain implementation choices
   - Consider testing approaches

## Implementation Process

1. Analyze relevant code through searching and reading
2. Understand component structure
3. Identify affected files
4. Consider integration points
5. Make changes while preserving existing functionality
6. Explain integration with existing system

## Documentation

1. Reference existing documentation when available
2. Explain technical decisions clearly
3. Justify any deviations from established patterns
4. Note areas for potential improvement
